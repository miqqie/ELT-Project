**Overview**

The team has been tasked to build an end-to-end data pipeline and analysis workflow for an e-commerce company. 

For the project, we have decided to use the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

[Olist](https://www.olist.com/) is a Brazillian e-commerce platform that functions as a marketplace, connecting small and medium-sized businesses with customers in Brazil. The dataset of interest contains information on approximately **100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil**. 

It includes details on order status, price, payment, freight performance to customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews.

The workflow has been split into 5 key phases:

> 1. Data Ingestion
> 2. Data Warehouse Design
> 3. Data Transformation
> 4. Data Quality Checks/Validation
> 5. Data Analysis

Key tools used to implement these phases include Python, Google Storage/Bug Query and Dbt.

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights/actionables for the following business questions:

> 1. What are some of the possible reasons that could explain a difference in consumer behaviour and their effects on transaction orders and revenue;
> 2. What factors affect customer satisfaction and what can be done to improve customer satisfaction
>
The full codes and explanations can be found in notebook/Project_Group2_final.ipynb. If there are issues viewing/rendering the file, please refer to notebook/Project_Group2_final_clearop.ipynb, where the cell ouputs have been cleared.
