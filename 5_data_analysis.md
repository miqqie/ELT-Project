### <u> Key Business Questions </u>

> 1. What are some of the possible reasons that could explain a difference in consumer behaviour and their effects on transaction orders and revenue;
> 2. What factors affect customer satisfaction and what can be done to improve customer satisfaction

### <u> Key Areas of Analysis </u>

To answer the identified business questions, our analysis has focused on these key areas:

> 1. **Analyze order fulfillment times, shipping delays, and delivery performance**. This could help to improve the customer experience and boost sales.
> 2. **Analyze customers reviews to extract sentiment and common themes**. This could help to improve product quality and customer service and boost sales.
> 2. **Analyse data on customers and sellers** on location and impact on customer satisfaction.

### <u> Key Findings </u>

1. There is **scope for differentiation in terms of marketing campaigns/promotions during peak order months**. E.g. for months driven by online sale events vs gift-giving holidays. The former has more customers making mulitples orders and the latter has higher average value per order. Further granularity could possibly be by the **best-selling product categories in the different peak order months**.

2. The **lower the review score is, the higher the proportion of non-null text comments provided by customers**. It is possible that customers may be more inclined to voice out what caused their dissatisfaction rathen than explain what made them satisfied. In future, perhaps the **review system could be revamped to encourage more detailed reviews in different categories** (e.g. delivery, product quality etc) so that we can gather more insights on what aspects of the transaction are the consumers are satisifed or disatisified with.

3. **Delivery times and later-than-expecected deliveries appear to have an impact on customer review scores**. Customers giving a 1 had to wait twice as long on average for their orders to be delivered, as compared to customers who gave a score of 5. **As a possible KPI we can set a standard to ensure most deliveries are delivered with 10-14 days from purchase**. (13 days was the 75% percentile for orders that scored 5 on reviews) Later-than-expected deliveries are also disproportionally higher for reviews that scored 1. Hence, the operations team could look into **providing more realistic estimated delivery times** while working on delivery efficiency and meeting the proposed KPI.
   
4. **The customer-to-seller ratio in a state could have an impact on the average review score from customers within that state**. There is a negative correlation of around **-0.7** between the two. Hence having sellers in proximity of customers may be beneficial. We could consider onboarding more sellers in the state of Rio De Janeiro, which has a relatively lower average review score, and higher customer-to-seller ratio as compared to the other states that are in the top 5 for customer payments.
